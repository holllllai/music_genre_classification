creating a new repository for music genre classification project.
The first step is to gather data from spotify api - gather id, genre, audio feature, and 30 seconds audio samples.
Goal is to create a get_data_using_spotify_api.py 
in order to use the spotify web api, 'pip install spotipy' as a start 

need to know how to get music from each genre. Yash Duo's post uses different playlists.. how did he get the playlists ids? and how to readjust the limits?
